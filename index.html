    <h3>Ques1. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h3>
   <h3>1. == (Loose Equality / Abstract Equality):</h3>

        <p>It compares two values for equality but performs type coercion if the values are of different types. 
        This means it will attempt to convert one or both values to the same type before making the comparison.</p>
        5 == '5'  // true, because '5' is coerced into the number 5 <br>
        true == 1 // true, because true is coerced into the number 1

<h3>2. === (Strict Equality):</h3>
<p>It compares two values for equality without performing type coercion. 
    Both the value and the type must be the same for it to return true.
</p>
5 === '5'  // false, because one is a number and the other is a string <br>
true === 1 // false, because one is a boolean and the other is a number

<h3>Ques2.What are the differences between var, let and const?</h3>
<ul>
    <h2>Var</h2>
        <li>Scope: Function or global-scoped.</li>
<li> Hoisting: Hoisted and initialized with undefined.</li>           
           <li> Reassignable: Yes, can be reassigned and redeclared in the same scope.</li>
    <h2>let</h2>
    <li>Scope: Block-scoped.</li>
       <li>Hoisting: Hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone).</li>
       <li>Reassignable: Yes, but cannot be redeclared in the same scope.</li>

       <h2>const</h2>
       <li>Scope: Block-scoped.</li>
        <li>Hoisting: Hoisted but not initialized (Temporal Dead Zone).</li>
        <li>Reassignable: No, cannot be reassigned or redeclared, but objects/arrays can be mutated</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ques3. What is execution context</h3>
<p>An **execution context** is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed, containing the scope, 
    variables, functions, and the `this` value at the time of execution.</p>

<h3>Ques4.What is creation phase and execution phase.</h3>
<p>The **Creation Phase** is when the JavaScript engine sets up the execution context, hoisting variables and functions, and determining the value of `this`. 
    The **Execution Phase** is when the code is executed line by line, and variables are assigned their actual values.</p>

    <h3>Ques5.What is hoisting?    </h3>
<p>**Hoisting** is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the creation phase, allowing them to be used before they are actually declared in the code.
     However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.</p>

<h3> Ques6.Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h3>
<pre>
 1. undefined:
             A variable is declared but not assigned a value.
            Example: let x; console.log(x); // undefined
            not defined:

2.not defined:      
            Refers to a variable that hasn't been declared at all in the current scope.
            Example: console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
            NaN (Not a Number):

3.NaN (Not a Number):          
            Represents a value that is not a valid number (often as a result of an invalid mathematical operation).
            Example: console.log(0 / 0); // NaN
    </pre>
<h3> Ques7.How many operators do we have in JS ?</h3>
<h3>JavaScript has 8 types of operators:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Arithmetic operators (e.g., +, -, *, /)</li>
       <li> Assignment operators (e.g., =, +=, -=)</li>
        <li>Comparison operators (e.g., ==, ===, >, < )</li>
        <li>Logical operators (e.g., &&, ||, !)</li>
       <li> Bitwise operators (e.g., &, |, ^)</li>
        <li>Unary operators (e.g., ++, --, typeof)</li>
        <li>Ternary operator (e.g., condition ? expr1 : expr2)</li>
        <li>Relational operators (e.g., in, instanceof)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Ques7.Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h3>
<pre>

1. Local Scope:
   - Refers to variables declared inside a function or block. These variables are only accessible within that specific function or block.

2. Block Scope:
   - Variables declared with `let` and `const` are **block-scoped**, meaning they are only accessible within the nearest enclosing `{}` block (e.g., inside loops, conditionals).

3. Functional Scope:
   - Variables declared inside a function are **function-scoped**, meaning they are only accessible within that function, and not outside it.

4. Scope Chain:
   - The scope chain is the hierarchy of scopes that JavaScript uses to look up variables. When a variable is accessed,
    JavaScript looks through the current scope, then the outer scopes, all the way up to the global scope.
